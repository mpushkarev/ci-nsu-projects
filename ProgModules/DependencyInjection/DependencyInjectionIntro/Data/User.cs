*  Description:                                                                *
*    Basic demonstration of dependency injection in a WinForms                 *
*    application, featuring a simple user authentication and                   *
*    registration system. The core logic is separated into service             *
*    interfaces and multiple implementations (including fake,                  *
*    list, and real authentication managers).                                  *
*    As one of my early projects using these patterns, some aspects            *
*    may be simplistic or suitable for further improvement.                    *
*                                                                              *
