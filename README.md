Only materials I found useful or worth keeping are included.

## 📚 Description

## 🚀 Features
- 💡 Projects use different programming languages.
- 📁 Tried to make the structure as convenient as possible.
- 🔄 New projects are added occasionally, if they are worth keeping.
- 🧊 Old/early projects are never improved or refactored — they’re frozen forever.

## 🌱 Plans
